# Contributing

Fork this repo. But if you know a friend who'd like to contribute, tell them to:
1. Modify the `Makefile` to push to docker image repository of choice
2. Test, via "make {container, push, all etc}"
3. Open a pull request

If that friend doesn't know what to contribute, tell them I need to stick nginx
in front of ghost and get TLS certificates.
