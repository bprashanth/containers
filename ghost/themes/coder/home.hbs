Bamf doesn't stand for anything. Not Bamfor Stevens reaction, not Bamfrônṭ,
not even bamf. It's just a flippant word we came up with on a whim.

Sometime later, we decided to use it as the hostname of a backup server. Being
young and ambitious we decide to run this backup server in france. How else
would we get our chrome crashdumps if disaster struck North America?

Sometime later, this backup server was called to action. Because of the nature
of tasks is was asked to perform, and the decency with which it conducted
itself in those trying times, we decided not to de-comission it. It continues
to live and run out of France.

Sometime later, someone started a markdown server on it, and we all started
writing in markdown. As you and I know, the only difference between science and
screwing around is writing it down.

The rest as they say, is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5_Sq7HvkcnSBsdEqrupPstObjimxhuQisBVJlLHkU0/edit#heading=h.rzuru8wouiyw">history</a>.

If you can figure out an authors name, you can view all their posts on bamf.
They can also choose to show you some posts under a given tag. Those are pretty
much the only ways to get anywhere. If you figure out an injection attack that
dumps out a list of authors, respect their privacy and mail bamfadm@google.com.

May you live long enough to have your software explained to you.
